# EDA-on-Hotel-booking-dataset
This data describes two datasets with hotel demand data. One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel (H2). Both datasets share the same structure, with 31 variables describing the 40060 observations of H1 and 79330 observations of H2. Each observation represents a hotel booking. Both datasets comprehend bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July 2015 and the 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled. Since this is hotel real data, all data elements pertaining to hotel or customer identification were deleted.

Steps involved:  Exploratory Data Analysis, Null value Treatment, Making some categorical 
                          Columns, Understanding Correlation among fields.

Conclusions:
1. Bed and Breakfast is the  most preferred type of meal
2. Most of the bookings are done through TA/TO and Direct channel.
3. Portugal is the country from which most numbers of guests come.
4. 41.7% of the total bookings were canceled for the City hotel and 21.7% for the Resort hotel.
5. Both hotels have a very small percentage that customers will repeat, but the Resort hotel has a slightly higher repeat % than City Hotel.
6. Guests from Portugal and Great Britain prefer economical rooms...
7. Almost 35% of bookings were canceled.
8. Most bookings are done by couples (although we are not sure that they are a couple as data doesn't tell about that).     It is clear from the graph that there is a sudden surge in the arrival number of couples and families in the months of July and August. So better plans can be planned accordingly at that time for these types of customers.
